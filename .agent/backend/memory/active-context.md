# Active Context

## Current Objective
Initialize and upgrade the backend agent ecosystem with Persistent Memory, Intent Routing, and specialized Skill Toolboxes.

## Current Session Goals
- [ ] Initialize `.agent/memory/active-context.md` and `project-patterns.md` [/]
- [ ] Deploy updated agent rules (Orchestrator, QA, Skeptic, Cost Optimizer, etc.) [ ]
- [ ] Bootstrap specialized Skill Toolboxes [ ]
- [ ] Verify functionality and hand over to user [ ]

## Recent Decisions
- Adopted the `cc10x` orchestration standards for the backend.
- Added **Skeptic** and **Cost Optimizer** agents to the standard roster.
- Enforced the "Iron Law": Read memory at start, update at completion.

## Next Steps
1. Finish initializing the memory layer.
2. Create the agent rule files.
3. Build out the skill toolboxes.
